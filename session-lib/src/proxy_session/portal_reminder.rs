//! Portal features reminder injected at session start and after each
//! compaction boundary.
//!
//! The reminder is sent to the agent only — wrapped in
//! `<system-reminder>…</system-reminder>` tags so Claude treats it as
//! out-of-band context. The user-facing copy was removed in #692: it ate too
//! much vertical scrollback for content the user already knows (they built
//! the portal), and the reminder's value is the agent recovering its
//! affordance knowledge after a fresh start / compaction.
//!
//! The reminder body lives in `session-lib/portal_reminder.md` as a
//! readable markdown file and is baked into the binary via `include_str!`.
//! Operators can override at runtime by pointing `PORTAL_REMINDER_FILE` at a
//! readable path; on a missing or unreadable override we log a warning and
//! fall back to the bundled default.
