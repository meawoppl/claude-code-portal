//! Agent-agnostic pieces of the proxy session (#1657).
//!
//! The proxy session — transport, heartbeat, reminder injection, input
//! delivery — serves **every** agent that runs under the proxy, but it grew up
//! inside `claude-session-lib`, where nothing in the module path said which
//! parts were shared. This module is the landing zone as those pieces hoist
//! out, slice by slice; `claude-session-lib::proxy_session` re-exports each
//! moved item so its internal call sites are unchanged.
